Traffic Volume Prediction
This project focuses on predicting traffic volume using a machine learning approach with a RandomForestRegressor model. The dataset used is the Metro Interstate Traffic Volume dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to predict the traffic volume based on various features such as weather conditions, date-time attributes, and lagged traffic volumes.

Project Overview
Traffic congestion is a common issue in urban areas, leading to delays and increased emissions. Accurate traffic volume prediction can help in traffic management and planning. This project aims to develop a predictive model for traffic volume using historical data and various features.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Metro Interstate Traffic Volume dataset, which contains traffic data from a highway in the Twin Cities area, Minnesota. The dataset includes features such as:

Date Time: Timestamp of the data point
Temperature: Temperature in Kelvin
Rain_1h: Amount of rain in the last hour (mm)
Snow_1h: Amount of snow in the last hour (mm)
Clouds_all: Cloudiness (%)
Weather_main: Main weather category (e.g., Clear, Clouds, Rain)
Weather_description: Detailed weather description
Traffic_volume: Traffic volume
Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps include:

Handling Missing Values: Missing values in the holiday column are replaced with 0 (indicating no holiday) or 1 (indicating a holiday).
Datetime Conversion: The date_time column is converted to a datetime object and set as the index.
Feature Engineering: Extracting features such as hour, day of the week, month, and year from the datetime index.
Lag Features: Creating lag features to capture temporal dependencies.
One-Hot Encoding: Converting categorical columns (weather_main and weather_description) into numerical columns using one-hot encoding.
Model Training and Evaluation
A RandomForestRegressor model is trained to predict traffic volume. The data is split into training and testing sets. The model is evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of the MSE.
R² Score: Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
Results
The model achieved the following performance:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 159.72
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 68101.92
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 260.96
R² Score: 0.9824
Accuracy: 98.24%
Conclusion
The RandomForestRegressor model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting traffic volume, explaining approximately 98.24% of the variance in the traffic volume data. This model can be useful for traffic management and planning in urban areas.
